IoT Monitoring System
The IoT Monitoring System is a Python-based smart home simulation platform.
It mimics the operation of common IoT devices such as smart lights, thermostats, and security cameras, all managed via a central automation controller.

This simulation is visualized using a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI), allowing real-time monitoring and control of devices in a virtual smart home environment.

How to Use the Dashboard
Once the GUI is running, you can monitor and interact with various smart devices using buttons and sliders:
Step-by-step Usage:
10.	Start/Stop Automation
Click the "Automation ON/OFF" button at the top to toggle smart automation.
11.	View Device Status
The top textbox shows if automation is currently active (ON or OFF). Device-specific statuses (like brightness or temperature) are displayed next to their respective controls.
12.	Control Devices Manually
Each device has buttons and sliders. For example: Adjust the light brightness using the slider under "Living room light brightness". Use the toggle buttons to turn devices ON or OFF.
13.	Randomize States
Press the "Randomize" button to simulate unpredictable real-world behavior.
